Setup system cron inorder to get the correct reporting results

###### Ensure you have the version of Moodle as stated above in 'Required version of Moodle'.  
 1. This is essential as the
    theme relies on underlying core code that is out of my control.
 2. Login as an administrator and put Moodle in 'Maintenance Mode' so that there are no users using it bar you as the
    administrator.
 3. Copy the replacement extracted Edwiser RemUI folder to the '/local/' folder.
 4. If automatic 'Purge all caches' appears not to work by lack of display etc. then perform a manual 'Purge all caches'
    under 'Home -> Site administration -> Development -> Purge all caches'.
 5. Put Moodle out of Maintenance Mode.
